## !!!!! MANDATORY !!!!!
- Hash any passwords stored in the database, if applicable.

- Protect the website against SQL injections and XSS attacks.

- Enable HTTPS for all website features and use WSS instead of WS if applicable.

- Implement form validation for all user input, either client-side or server-side, depending on the backend.

#### Implementing a remote authentication.
In this major module, the goal is to implement the following authentication system:
OAuth 2.0 authentication with 42. Key features and objectives include:

- [ ] Integrate the authentication system, allowing users to securely sign in.
- [ ] Obtain the necessary credentials and permissions from the authority to enable a secure login.
- [ ] Implement user-friendly login and authorization flows that adhere to best practices and security standards.
- [ ] Ensure the secure exchange of authentication tokens and user information between the web application and the authentication provider.

Be careful, the management of duplicate usernames/emails is at your discretion. You must provide a solution that makes sense.

### Phase 4 : The actual game + live chat 

- [ ] Implement a local Pong game for two players using the same keyboard.
- [ ] Add the ability to play against remote players via a Remote Players module.
- [ ] Set up a matchmaking system to organize matches and announce upcoming battles.
- [ ] Ensure uniform paddle speed rules for all players, including AI.
- [ ] Develop the Pong game following frontend constraints or use the FrontEnd/Graphics module for visual enhancements.
